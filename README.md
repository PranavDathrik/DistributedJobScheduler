# Distributed Job Scheduler
Overview:
Create a distributed job scheduling system that manages and schedules jobs across multiple nodes in a cluster, optimizing for load balancing and resource utilization.

# Components:
    Master Node: Manages the job queue, distributes jobs to worker nodes, and monitors their status.
    Worker Nodes: Execute jobs assigned by the master node and report their status and resource usage.
    Job Queue: A priority queue to manage pending jobs, supporting different scheduling policies (e.g., FIFO, priority-based).
    Monitoring and Reporting: Real-time monitoring of node health and resource usage, with a dashboard for visualization.
# Technologies:
Programming Languages: Python or Go or C++
Distributed Systems Framework: Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for communication
Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana for metrics collection and visualization
Containerization: Docker for containerized job execution

Implementation Steps:
Architecture Setup:

Design the architecture with master and worker nodes.
Set up a communication framework using Kafka or RabbitMQ.
Job Queue and Scheduling:

Implement a job queue in the master node.
Develop scheduling policies (FIFO, priority-based) and integrate them into the job queue.
Worker Node Implementation:

Set up worker nodes to receive and execute jobs.
Ensure workers can report job status and resource usage back to the master.
Resource Monitoring:

Integrate Prometheus for resource monitoring on worker nodes.
Set up Grafana for visualizing resource usage and job statuses.
Dashboard Development:

Create a dashboard using a web framework (e.g., Flask for Python).
Display real-time job status, resource utilization, and system health metrics.
Testing and Optimization:

Test the system with various workloads.
Optimize job scheduling algorithms and resource utilization.
Project Timeline:
Week 1-2: Architecture design and setting up communication framework.
Week 3-4: Implement job queue and scheduling policies.
Week 5-6: Develop worker node functionality and integrate with master.
Week 7-8: Integrate monitoring tools and develop the dashboard.
Week 9-10: Testing, optimization, and documentation.
